Second, it determines the classification model accuracy by using Deep Belief Network method so it would be able to be applied into the tweet classification, to highlight the sentiment class of training data tweet in Bahasa Indonesia. Based on the experimental result, it can be concluded that the best method in managing tweet data is the DBN method with an accuracy of 93.31%, compared with  Naive Bayes method which has an accuracy of 79.10%, and SVM (Support Vector Machine) method with an accuracy of 92.18%.\n","\n","['sentiment', 'analysi', 'comput', 'research', 'opinion', 'sentiment', 'emot', 'express', 'textual', 'mode', 'twitter', 'becom', 'popular', 'communic', 'devic', 'among', 'internet', 'user', 'deep', 'learn', 'new', 'area', 'machin', 'learn', 'research', 'aim', 'move', 'machin', 'learn', 'closer', 'main', 'goal', 'artifici', 'intellig', 'purpos', 'deep', 'learn', 'chang', 'manual', 'engin', 'learn', 'growth', 'deep', 'learn', 'algorithm', 'arrang', 'focus', 'nonlinear', 'data', 'represent', 'one', 'machin', 'learn', 'method', 'deep', 'belief', 'network', 'dbn', 'deep', 'belief', 'network', 'dbn', 'includ', 'deep', 'learn', 'method', 'stack', 'sever', 'algorithm', 'extract', 'featur', 'optim', 'util', 'resourc', 'studi', 'two', 'point', 'first', 'aim', 'classifi', 'posit', 'negat', 'neutral', 'sentiment', 'toward', 'test', 'data', 'second', 'determin', 'classif', 'model', 'accuraci', 'use', 'deep', 'belief', 'network', 'method', 'would', 'abl', 'appli', 'tweet', 'classif', 'highlight', 'sentiment', 'class', 'train', 'data', 'tweet', 'bahasa', 'indonesia', 'base', 'experiment', 'result', 'conclud', 'best', 'method', 'manag', 'tweet', 'data', 'dbn', 'method', 'accuraci', 'compar', 'naiv', 'bay', 'method', 'accuraci', 'svm', 'support', 'vector', 'machin', 'method', 'accuraci']\n","\n","Movie has unique characteristics. When someone writes an opinions about a movie, not only the story in the movie itself is written, but also the people involved in the movie are also written. Opinion ordinary movie written in social media primarily  twitter.To get a tendency of opinion on the movie, whether opinion is likely  positive, negative or neutral, it takes a sentiment analysis. This study aims to classify the sentiment is positive, negative and neutral from opinions Indonesian language movie and look for the accuracy, precission, recall and f-meausre of the method used is Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network. The test results on a system that is built to show that Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network algorithm provides accuracy results better than Naive Bayes method, the value of accuracy of 80,99%, the value of precission 81,00%, recall 81,00%, f-measure 79,00%   while the value of the resulting accuracy Naive Bayes amounted to 76,21%, precission 78,00%, recall 76,00%, f-measure 75,00%.\n","\n","['movi', 'uniqu', 'characterist', 'someon', 'write', 'opinion', 'movi', 'stori', 'movi', 'written', 'also', 'peopl', 'involv', 'movi', 'also', 'written', 'opinion', 'ordinari', 'movi', 'written', 'social', 'media', 'primarili', 'twitterto', 'get', 'tendenc', 'opinion', 'movi', 'whether', 'opinion', 'like', 'posit', 'negat', 'neutral', 'take', 'sentiment', 'analysi', 'studi', 'aim', 'classifi', 'sentiment', 'posit', 'negat', 'neutral', 'opinion', 'indonesian', 'languag', 'movi', 'look', 'accuraci', 'preciss', 'recal', 'fmeausr', 'method', 'use', 'dynam', 'convolut', 'neural', 'network', 'test', 'result', 'system', 'built', 'show', 'dynam', 'convolut', 'neural', 'network', 'algorithm', 'provid', 'accuraci', 'result', 'better', 'naiv', 'bay', 'method', 'valu', 'accuraci', 'valu', 'preciss', 'recal', 'fmeasur', 'valu', 'result', 'accuraci', 'naiv', 'bay', 'amount', 'preciss', 'recal', 'fmeasur']\n","\n","The rapid development of the internet and social media and a large amount of text data has become an important research subject in obtaining information from the text data. In recent years, there has been an increase in research on sentiment analysis in the review text to determine the polarity of opinion on social media. However, there are still few studies that apply the deep learning method, namely Long Short-Term Memory for sentiment analysis in Indonesian texts. This study aims to classify Indonesian novel novels based on positive, neutral and negative sentiments using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method. The dataset used is a review of Indonesian language novels taken from the goodreads.com site. In the testing process, the LSTM method will be compared with the Naïve Bayes method based on the calculation of the values of accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure. Based on the test results show that the Long Short-Term Memory method has better accuracy results than the Naïve Bayes method with an accuracy value of 72.85%, 73% precision, 72% recall, and 72% f-measure compared to the results of the Naïve Bayes method accuracy with accuracy value of 67.88%, precision 69%, recall 68%, and f-measure 68%.\n","\n","['rapid', 'develop', 'internet', 'social', 'media', 'larg', 'amount', 'text', 'data', 'becom', 'import', 'research', 'subject', 'obtain', 'inform', 'text', 'data', 'recent', 'year', 'increas', 'research', 'sentiment', 'analysi', 'review', 'text', 'determin', 'polar', 'opinion', 'social', 'media', 'howev', 'still', 'studi', 'appli', 'deep', 'learn', 'method', 'name', 'long', 'shortterm', 'memori', 'sentiment', 'analysi', 'indonesian', 'text', 'studi', 'aim', 'classifi', 'indonesian', 'novel', 'novel', 'base', 'posit', 'neutral', 'negat', 'sentiment', 'use', 'long', 'shortterm', 'memori', 'lstm', 'method', 'dataset', 'use', 'review', 'indonesian', 'languag', 'novel', 'taken', 'goodreadscom', 'site', 'test', 'process', 'lstm', 'method', 'compar', 'naïv', 'bay', 'method', 'base', 'calcul', 'valu', 'accuraci', 'precis', 'recal', 'fmeasur', 'base', 'test', 'result', 'show', 'long', 'shortterm', 'memori', 'method', 'better', 'accuraci', 'result', 'naïv', 'bay', 'method', 'accuraci', 'valu', 'precis', 'recal', 'fmeasur', 'compar', 'result', 'naïv', 'bay', 'method', 'accuraci', 'accuraci', 'valu', 'precis', 'recal', 'fmeasur']\n","\n","Ship identification on satellite imagery can be used for fisheries management, monitoring of smuggling activities, ship traffic services, and naval warfare. However, high-resolution satellite imagery also makes the segmentation of the ship difficult in the background, so that to handle it requires reliable features so that it can be identified adequately between large vessels, small vessels and not ships. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method, which has the advantage of being able to extract features automatically and produce reliable features that facilitate ship identification. This study combines CNN ZFNet architecture with the Random Forest method. The training was conducted with the aim of knowing the accuracy of the ZFNet layers to produce the best features, which are characterized by high accuracy, combined with the Random Forest method. Testing the combination of this method is done with two parameters, namely batch size and a number of trees. The test results identify large vessels with an accuracy of 87.5% and small vessels with an accuracy of not up to 50%.\n","\n","['ship', 'identif', 'satellit', 'imageri', 'use', 'fisheri', 'manag',
