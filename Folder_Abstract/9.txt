The rapid development of the internet and social media and a large amount of text data has become an important research subject in obtaining information from the text data. In recent years, there has been an increase in research on sentiment analysis in the review text to determine the polarity of opinion on social media. However, there are still few studies that apply the deep learning method, namely Long Short-Term Memory for sentiment analysis in Indonesian texts. This study aims to classify Indonesian novel novels based on positive, neutral and negative sentiments using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method. The dataset used is a review of Indonesian language novels taken from the goodreads.com site. In the testing process, the LSTM method will be compared with the Naïve Bayes method based on the calculation of the values of accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure. Based on the test results show that the Long Short-Term Memory method has better accuracy results than the Naïve Bayes method with an accuracy value of 72.85%, 73% precision, 72% recall, and 72% f-measure compared to the results of the Naïve Bayes method accuracy with accuracy value of 67.88%, precision 69%, recall 68%, and f-measure 68%.
