The volume density of vehicles is a problem that often occurs in every city, as for the impact of vehicle density is congestion. Classification of vehicle density levels on certain roads is required because there are at least 7 vehicle density level conditions. Monitoring conducted by the police, the Department of Transportation and the organizers of the road currently using video-based surveillance such as CCTV that is still monitored by people manually. Deep Learning is an approach of synthetic neural network-based learning machines that are actively developed and researched lately because it has succeeded in delivering good results in solving various soft-computing problems, This research uses the convolutional neural network architecture. This research tries to change the supporting parameters on the convolutional neural network to further calibrate the maximum accuracy. After the experiment changed the parameters, the classification model was tested using K-fold cross-validation, confusion matrix and model exam with data testing. On the K-fold cross-validation test with an average yield of 92.83% with a value of K (fold) = 5, model testing is done by entering data testing amounting to 100 data, the model can predict or classify correctly i.e. 81 data.
