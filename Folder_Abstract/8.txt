The test results on a system that is built to show that Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network algorithm provides accuracy results better than Naive Bayes method, the value of accuracy of 80,99%, the value of precission 81,00%, recall 81,00%, f-measure 79,00%   while the value of the resulting accuracy Naive Bayes amounted to 76,21%, precission 78,00%, recall 76,00%, f-measure 75,00%.
